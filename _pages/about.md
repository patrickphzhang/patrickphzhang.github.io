Research
======
My research interests lie in computer system security. In particular, my research lies at operating systems, program analysis, compiler trasformation &optimization, and fuzzing. I have been working in the following directions:
1. Hardware-assisted execution environment, particularly for Linux eBPF.
2. Compiler-based code optimization and obfuscation.
3. Binary analysis and binary code similarity detection.

Skills
======
* Compiler: Proficient in LLVM compiler architecture, middle-end and back-end programming, including program analysis, code transformation, and reinforcement. 
* Kernel: Experienced in kernel bypassing, eBPF, Linux kernel analysis, operating system development, and kernel debugging.
* Reverse Engineering: Skilled in binary code diffing and rewriting techniques.
* Others: Familiar with Intel/ARM hardware characteristics, Trusted Execution Environment principles and design, and fuzz testing.
* Programming Languages: C / C++ / Python / JavaScript / Java / Shell

Awards
======
* Outstanding Student of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019 and 2022
* Outstanding student of State Key Laboratory of Architecture in 2021
* Outstanding Contribution Award for Cultural Construction of State Key Laboratory of Architecture in 2019
