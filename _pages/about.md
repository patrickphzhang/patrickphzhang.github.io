I work in WeChat group of Tencent now. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Architecture from ICT in 2024. My research interest lies in the security of computer systems. My current research focus is the operatiing system security, program analysis and optimization, and etc.

Research
======
My research interests lie in computer system security. In particular, my research lies at operating systems, program analysis, compiler trasformation &optimization, and fuzzing. I have been working in the following directions.
<!-- 1. 
1. Compiler-based code optimization and obfuscation
1. Binary analysis and binary code similarity detection -->

Hardware-assisted execution environment
------
eBPF has become a critical component in Linux. To ensure kernel security, BPF programs are statically verified before being loaded and executed in the kernel. However, the state-of-the-art eBPF verifier has both security and complexity issues. To this end, we choose to look at BPF programs from a new perspective and regard them as a new type of kernel-mode application, thus an isolation-based rather than a verification-based approach is needed. In this research, we propose an isolation execution environment for BPF programs on AArch64.

Compiler-based code optimization and obfuscation

Binary analysis and binary code similarity detection

spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
